  <b>Code A2Z</b> is an open-source project that empowers developers to build, learn, and collaborate through structured modular design and real-time tools.
</p>

## About Code A2Z

> [!NOTE]
> Code A2Z is the unified space for developers to build, learn, and collaborate through real-world open-source contributions.

### :zap: For Developers

Code A2Z is an open-source full-stack platform crafted with React + Vite + MUI on the frontend and Node.js + Express + MongoDB on the backend.
It’s designed with a highly modular architecture, clean folder conventions, atomic JOTAI state management, and real-time editor synchronization, offering developers a modern and maintainable foundation for scalable projects.

### :zap: For Users

Code A2Z is not just another project — it’s an ecosystem built to empower developers.
The platform’s goal is to create a space where ideas turn into collaborative code.
It bridges the gap between solo learning and team development by combining real-time editing, intelligent project organization, subscription-based updates, and structured contribution systems.
Future releases will expand into AI-driven productivity tools, personalized feeds, and real-time collaboration analytics to make it the go-to platform for every developer who wants to build, learn, and grow together.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can directly explore the project and start contributing using either setup:
>
> - Frontend only → linked to deployed backend
> - Full-stack setup → both client and server locally
> - Follow the setup method that best fits your contribution focus.
> - You can get required credentials from the `/docs` folder [`SETUP.md`](./docs/SETUP.md).
